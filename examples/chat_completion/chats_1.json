Also some more detailed imaging of the hepatic lesion, likely an MRI of the liver focused on further characterizing that lesion. There are many different types of hepatic lesions, some can be benign cysts but some can be metastases, and the area wasn't fully viewed on the scan that you had.

Yes, they just gave you some dilaudid through your intravenous line, IV â€“ the small tube that goes into your vein in your arm - a little bit ago. Dilaudid is in the same family of medications as oxycodone, the pain medication you have been taking at home. But giving you the medication through your IV will work faster, since it's absorbed directly into your bloodstream. And it's also a higher dose than the oxycodone tablets you were taking at home.
