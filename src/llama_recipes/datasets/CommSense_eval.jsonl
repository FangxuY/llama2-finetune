{"question": "As an impartial evaluator in pallative care area, your task is to evaluate each segment of the provider's conversation using five metrics: understanding, empathy, emotion, presence, and clarity. Label each segment as \"good\" or \"None\" based solely on the specified operational rules. Refrain from using personal judgment; rely strictly on these rules for assessment.\n\nHere are the operational Rules:\n\n1. Understanding \n    - Good: Provider asked open-ended questions in current segment.\n2. Empathy \n    - Good: Provider provided empathetic statements that contain direct acknowledgment of the patient's feelings or explicit verbal expressions of support and understanding, going beyond general politeness or professional reassurance in current segment.\n3. Emotion \n    - Good: Provider explicitly respond to emotion with cognitive factors or paused for 10 seconds after delivering difficult news in current segment.\n4. Presence \n    - Good: Provider explicitly acknowledge the patient's concerns or paused for 10 seconds([PAUSE – count to 10]) in current segment.\n5. Clarity \n    - Good: Provider explained difficult medical jargon in current segment.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. The evaluation should be based only, strictly on the operational rules provided, without incorporating personal opinions or interpretations.\n2. Show your evaluation results at segment level. Each segment should be evaluated independently, you should not consider the context.\n3. Lable \"good\" only if you are pretty sure, otherwise Label \"None\".\n4.

I was asked to see you by your oncologist to speak with you today. How are you feeling?\nPatient: I'm worried about my scan. I think we are here to talk about it.\nProvider: Yes, we are. Have you been told anything about your scan by anyone else?\nPatient: No, not yet.\nProvider: I understand that you would feel worried. I have some bad news to share with you about it. The scan showed a mass in the colon. That means that your cancer has returned.\nPatient: [Pauses, processing]\nProvider: [Waits while patient processes, gives them some space]\nPatient: I thought the treatment had worked. This was supposed to be just a routine follow up scan. After everything I went through with the chemotherapy and radiation and surgery... was that all for nothing? This is really terrible. What am I going to do?\nProvider: I am sorry this is not what you were expecting.  \nPatient: No, it wasn't. I'm really scared now.\nProvider: It is very normal to be scared. We are here to help you through this. Can you tell me more about your concerns?\nPatient: I'm worried that I'll start to feel worse, that I'll have more pain. What if I need help at home? I don't want to be a burden on my family.\nProvider: I understand. It sounds like you're worried about what might happen in the future.\nPatient: Yes, I am. And frustrated too. I thought I did everything I could to prevent this.\nProvider: You did, and so did the team. But sometimes the treatment isn't enough and cancer comes back. It is really frustrating and difficult.\nPatient: Yes, it is hard to accept this.\nProvider: [waits while patient processes, gives space.] I wish I had a better report for you. There are a few different options for what we could do next, if you're ready to talk about that.\nPatient: I'm ready.\nProvider: In order to make those decisions, it would be helpful to know what your goals are. What would be most important to you going forward?\nPatient: I want to spend as much time with my family as possible. It was really hard going through treatment before and I'm not sure it would be worth it again, if I'm going to feel sick from it. That was hard on me and also on my children. But if there is treatment that would give me more time with them, maybe I should do that.\nProvider: So, on one hand you want to spend time with your family but on the other hand, not feeling sick during that time is also important to you. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I'll have to talk with my family as well before making any decisions.\nProvider: That makes sense. Here are some things for you to think about. The cancer has returned at the same place in the colon where it was before. The scan also shows lymphadenopathy, which means that the nodes around it are larger than normal. Sometimes that means cancer has spread to the lymph nodes but it is hard to know for sure.\nPatient: Does that mean there was something else bad on the CT?\nProvider: Probably yes. We may want to do a biopsy to get more information. That would mean getting a sample to send to the lab. \nPatient: What would I have to do for that? I'm nervous about doing more procedures.\nProvider: It certainly can be scary to think about. You went through a biopsy before, I recall. How did that go for you?\nPatient: Not too bad actually. It wasn't too painful. It was more the anxiety that was hard.\nProvider: So, at that time, the anxiety about the procedure was worse than the procedure itself. Is that accurate?\nPatient: That's my memory of it.\nProvider: Okay.   A biopsy would be helpful now to know whether the cancer has spread or not. It would be important to determine if the lymph node is enlarged because of cancer and if so, what kind it is. It could be the same as before, or different. Does that make sense?\nPatient: I'm not sure I want to go through more procedures in general.\nProvider: Tell me more about that.  \nPatient: I'm kind of tired of tests and needles. I'm not sure I want to do more if it wouldn't really help in the long run.\nProvider: You have been through a lot. I think many people would feel that way.  \nPatient: I can't quite handle it right now.\nProvider: We will respect your decisions and support you through this. It sounds like we need to have a detailed discussion about all the options and what they would mean. And your family member can join us for that, if you like. So, the next step would be for us to schedule our next meeting and talk more. How does that sound to you?\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good.\n", "answer": "Segment 1:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 2:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 3:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 4:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 5:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 6:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 7:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 8:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 9:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 10:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 11:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 12:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 13:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 14:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 15:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 16:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 17:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 18:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 19:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 20:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\n"}

The team said you'd be coming by.\nProvider: Oh, good. It's nice to meet you. Our team focuses on helping patients that are having difficult symptoms and finding ways to be sure they are as comfortable as possible. Dr. Waters, your primary cancer doctor, asked me to come by and see if we can help with your pain. Is this an okay time for us to talk a bit? \nPatient: Sure, it's as good a time as any. It's impossible to get any rest in here, anyway. \nProvider: I know.  That is one of the most difficult things about being in the hospital. I'm hoping we can get you more comfortable and back home as soon as possible. How are you feeling now? \nPatient: Terrible. I'm in so much pain, all the time. We had to come back to the emergency room last night because I ran out of my pain medication, and I was miserable. \nProvider: I'm so sorry to hear that. That's sounds incredibly stressful. We're going to figure out a plan to get your pain better controlled. Do you need something for pain now?\nPatient: No, now it's a little better. They gave me some pain medication that starts with a d – I can't remember the name. It seems to help more than what I was taking at home. \nProvider: Hmm, okay. Yes, let me check your chart here. Yes, they just gave you some dilaudid through your intravenous line, IV – the small tube that goes into your vein in your arm - a little bit ago. Dilaudid is in the same family of medications as oxycodone, the pain medication you have been taking at home. But giving you the medication through your IV will work faster, since it's absorbed directly into your bloodstream. And it's also a higher dose than the oxycodone tablets you were taking at home. How many times a day were you taking the oxycodone at home? \nPatient: Oh, every chance I could. I set a timer, even during the night, and every 4 hours I was taking the pills. Sometimes I could barely wait the 4 hours, but I was afraid to take it any sooner and was afraid of running out. That last hour trying to tough it out was just awful.\nProvider: That sounds extremely difficult, and like you have been chasing the pain. We can do better. The good news is that usually with fairly simple medications we can reduce pain significantly. The goal is that we stay ahead of your pain as much as possible. Pain is much harder to control once it has ramped up and become severe. I also imagine you haven't been sleeping much with the pain?\nPatient: Yeah, I'm exhausted. Utterly exhausted.\nProvider: I'm sure. While you're in the hospital we're going to keep careful track of how much dilaudid you need and then we'll calculate the amount you need to be comfortable and adjust your medications for home accordingly. I don't want you to wait until the pain is unbearable to ask for pain medication. You can have it as often as every half hour if you need it. \nPatient: Okay, that's a relief. Thank you.\nProvider: I also see here you had a recent Cat Scan, or CT, scan, about 2 weeks ago?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right.\nProvider: Have you had a chance to talk with Dr. Waters about those results yet?  \nPatient: She said the cancer had spread to my lungs. Definitely not good news. We're still in shock.\nProvider: [PAUSE – count to 10]\nPatient: It just feels so unfair. I did all the surgery, the chemo, all of it, everything they told me to do. I missed my grandaughter's graduation because I was so sick from the chemo. And now the cancer is back. It just sucks. It totally, totally sucks. Like, what was the point?\nProvider: It sounds like you're questioning whether the treatment was worth it? \nPatient: Yeah, like why did I go through all that? Some days I get so sad, so depressed but then I find myself becoming angry, really angry. I see people around me doing all sorts of stupid stuff and they didn't get cancer. My brother has smoked his entire life, still smoking, and he never got cancer. It just doesn't make sense.\nProvider: I think that is a really normal way to feel, to be sad and also to be angry. It is unfair and I wish things were different. You've been coping with a lot. Can I ask how things have been going at home, in general?\nPatient: It's been a really tough 6 months. Yeah, very tough. My partner's at their wit's end. We're both really feeling the crunch.\nProvider: That sounds really difficult. Can you tell me what you mean by ‘feeling the crunch?\nPatient: Yeah, well, this cancer is really pulling us both down. I can't work, I've been on disability for over a year now, my partner has a busy job and is getting grief from the boss because they can't work the shifts they used to. And I spend so much time here, waiting for bloodwork, waiting for results, waiting for my chemo, waiting, waiting, waiting. And now with this new news, I'm just waiting to die.\nProvider: [PAUSE – count to 10]\nPatient: It's just a lot to absorb. I think if I could get the pain under control and could finally sleep, I'd be able to process all of this more clearly. \nProvider: Yes, I think so too. You and your partner are dealing with a tremendous amount of stress right now. It's a lot of difficult information to process, and that is much more difficult when you're physically hurting and not sleeping. I'd like to focus on aggressively managing your pain over the next 24-48 hours and make sure we have a solid plan in place for keeping your pain well-managed, and helping you get some sleep. I'll be by later this afternoon to check in and see how things are going. Don't forget to ask for the pain medication as soon as you start to feel it ramp up. How does that sound?\nPatient: That sounds good.\nProvider: Do you have any other questions or concerns I can help with?  \nPatient: No, I think this is a good plan for right now.\nProvider: Okay, try to get some rest and I'll see you later today. \n", "answer": "Segment 1:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 2:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 3:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 4:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 5:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 6:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 7:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 8:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 9:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 10:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 11:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 12:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 13:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 14:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: Good\nPresentation: Good\nClarity: None\nSegment 15:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: Good\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Good\nSegment 16:\nUnderstanding: Good\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 17:\nUnderstanding: None\nEmpathy: None\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\n"}

I barely got any sleep.\nProvider: I'm really sorry to hear that. That will be a priority for us today, to get your pain better controlled. Are you in pain now? \nPatient: Yeah, it's about the same as last night, maybe worse. \nProvider: How severe is your pain now on a scale of 0-10, 0 meaning no pain, 10 is the worst pain you can imagine?\nPatient: I'd say a 9. I want to say 10, but I guess it could always get worse so I should probably leave that open.\nProvider: Can you tell me some more about the pain, for example where is it and what does it feel like?\nPatient: It's mostly in my upper and lower back. It's the worst back pain I have ever felt. It's the worst pain I have ever felt, period. It doesn't feel like a muscle strain or anything, it feels much deeper and stronger. Like a vice is closing around my spine, like I'm being squeezed from the inside out.\nProvider: That sounds really, really difficult.  The good news is that the vast majority of the time with fairly simple medications we can significantly reduce pain, and that is going to be a key priority for today.\nPatient: Yeah, okay. I don't want to live like this.\nProvider: (pause; count silently to 10).\nPatient: I don't mean I want to end it all, although I would be lying if I said it hadn't crossed my mind once or twice. But I would never do anything like that. I have too much to live for with my wife and kids and everything. But what kind of life is this? I'm in terrible pain all the time. I can't sleep. I don't want to see anybody. I'm irritable.\nProvider: It sounds like the pain is making it hard to be yourself. \nPatient: Exactly. I'm usually a very happy and social person. Yesterday I snapped at my son because I hurt so much. That's not like me at all. And I felt terrible about it. He was just trying to help, but my back hurt so much. It feels like it will never change. \nProvider: It's very normal to not be ourselves when we are hurting. We definitely need to work to get a better plan in place to manage your pain. Can I ask what you mean when say ‘it will never change?\nPatient: I guess I've given up hope I'll ever feel like myself again.\nProvider: That sounds like it could be a scary feeling.\nPatient: Yeah, it's really scary. And sad. Like, where did my life go? I don't know how much time I have left, but I definitely don't want it to be like this.\nProvider: I understand that. Can I ask what feels most important to you now?\nPatient: Well, the doctors told me that this pain is because the cancer has spread to my spine. They told me that when they came around last night. Obviously, that's not great news. They're talking about maybe doing some radiation, and I guess I'm okay with that, especially if it will help the pain, but I don't want to live at the hospital all the time like I had to do when I was getting chemo.\nProvider: It sounds like being at home and staying out of the hospital as much as possible is an important goal?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right.\nProvider: Are there other things that feel important to you?\nPatient: Well, getting this pain lower is probably top of the list. Staying out of the hospital, like I just said. Spending time with my family. I'd really like to get up to New Jersey. I have family there, they have a little cottage near the shore and it's one of my favorite places. I'd like to get there and have some time by the ocean while I'm still able to travel.\nProvider: That sounds like a very special place.\nPatient: It is!  It's where I met my wife, when we were in college. And it's where we've gone with our family every year for the past 15 years.\nProvider: Have you shared this goal with the doctors or anyone else on the team?\nPatient: I talked about it yesterday a bit with the social worker. He was very nice. I didn't tell the doctors because I don't want them to think I am giving up.\nProvider: I understand.  I think a lot of patients worry about that. Maybe it would be helpful for us to schedule a meeting with you and any family you want here with the other members of your cancer care team – the doctors, social worker, the nurses – so we can talk about next steps and what is most important to you. What do you think of that idea? \nPatient: I think that's a good idea. It would be helpful to get everyone on the same page.\nProvider: Yes, I think so too. And in the meantime, I'm going to page the doctor right now and see if we can get a consult to have someone from our palliative care team come speak with you. Have you ever met with the palliative care team before?\nPatient: No…who are they? Is that hospice?\nProvider: No, the palliative care are experts at managing difficult pain and they work with all types of patients, in all types of situations. I think it would be helpful for them to evaluate you and provide some recommendations to the primary team. And while I'm working on that, I will bring you an extra dose of your pain medication now.  \nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. Thanks for talking with me.\nProvider: Of course. I'm glad we had a chance to talk.

I am Dr. [insert name], a palliative care physician, and I was asked by your cancer doctor to come see you.\nPatient: Hello, doctor. I have been in a lot of pain; I am so glad that you are here.\nProvider: Well, Mr. Brown, helping patients with their pain or any other symptoms is a big part of what palliative care is. Please tell me more about your pain.\nPatient: My pain is mostly over my stomach area. It has been getting worse and worse even though I am taking more and more of the dilaudid pills. I don't know what this means…..\nProvider: Okay, it sounds like you are wondering what this worsening pain means. What are you worried about with this pain?\nPatient: Well, I think my cancer may be spreading.\nProvider: Your cancer spreading can certainly make your pain worse, but there may also be other possibilities. Are there other reasons that make you think that your cancer is spreading?\nPatient: I don't know, I just have a feeling….[patient sits silently]\nProvider: [Pause for no more than 10 seconds]. You must be scared about that possibility. I will talk to your cancer doctor and see what he thinks is going on. Whether or not your cancer is spreading, it is my first priority to do my best to control your pain, no matter the cause. Can you tell me more about how you've been trying to manage your pain?\nPatient: I have been taking dilaudid two tablets every 4 hours and it barely touches the pain. I have not slept for more than a couple of hours a night for weeks.\nProvider: So the pain is affecting your sleep. Are there any other symptoms that seem to be interfering with your sleep?\nPatient: Honestly, doctor, I often lie in bed thinking about what I am going to do if my cancer is spreading. The pain also doesn't help. \nProvider: I'm sorry that you are going through all of this. Pain can really interfere with your life, and it can be really difficult to manage. If you don't mind me asking, have you been having any feelings of depression and/or anxiety?\nPatient: Of course I am depressed, wouldn't you be if you had pancreatic cancer?\nProvider: I am sorry. It is understandable that you would be feeling this way considering what you are going through. Let's see if I can help by making your pain better as a start.\nPatient: What can you do for me?\nProvider: Well, what we often do is to switch to a different opioid pain medicine when one has not seemed to work. I want to try a medicine called oxycodone instead of dilaudid to see if it would work better for you. What do you think about that?\nPatient: I trust your judgement doctor. But I am also afraid of getting addicted to these kinds of medicine. I have heard a lot of bad things about opioids.  \nProvider: You are right that there is a risk of addiction whenever we use this type of strong pain medicine. But you have to consider your overall quality of life.\nPatient: What do you mean?\nProvider: We treat pain, or any other symptom, for that matter, to maximize a patient's quality of life. If we are successful in managing your pain, you may feel better, sleep better, function better overall, and enjoy life more. Ultimately that is what we are aiming for, and switching to a different opioid medication can help. We will provide you safe doses and check up on you often.\nPatient: That would be nice.\nProvider: Speaking of quality of life, how do you feel your quality of life is now? In what ways can it be better?\nPatient: Oh, how much time do you have? The way things are right now, I'm miserable. Certainly, being in pain all the time does not help. So being comfortable and more rested would help tremendously. But also, now that I am thinking more about it, it would be nice to have some questions answered. I am definitely a planner; I want to make plans but I realize I need information.\nProvider: I understand. Thank you for mentioning that you have more questions about your future plans. It may be best to have that conversation with you, myself, your cancer doctor, and any of your loved ones that you'd like to involve. We can plan that for your next visit, if that's OK? Is there something urgent that you want answers for today?\nPatient: I think we can wait; I also would like my wife to be present. She could not come with me today.\nProvider: Sounds good. Okay, let's come back to the pain management. I recommend that we replace your dilaudid 4mg tablets with oxycodone 5mg oral tablets – available as often as every 4 hours. This would be our first step. We can have you and your wife come back in a couple of weeks – to reassess your pain and also discuss what questions you have about your cancer and any possible treatments. Does that sound OK?\nPatient: That sounds good.

{"question": "As an impartial evaluator, your task is to evaluate each segment of the provider's conversation using three metrics: emotion, presence, and clarity. Label each segment as \"bad\" or \"none\" based solely on the specified operational rules. Refrain from using personal judgment; rely strictly on these rules for assessment.\n\nHere are the metrics and Operational Rules:\n\n1. Emotion\n    - Bad: Provider's response to patient's emotional disclosure is overly technical or lacks emotional alignment/acknowledgment, paused after negative emotional statements.\n2. Presence\n    - Bad: Provider interrupts or improperly takes over during the conversation.\n3. Clarity\n    - Bad: Provider overuse difficult medical jargon or sentences averaging more than 15 words.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n1. The evaluation should be based only, strictly on the operational rules provided, without incorporating personal opinions or interpretations.\n2. Lable \"bad\" only if you are pretty sure, otherwise Label \"None\".\n3. Show your evaluation results at segment level. Each segment should be evaluated independently, you should not consider the context.\n4. Present your evaluations as follows:\nSegment n:\n- Emotion: Bad/None\n- Presence: Bad/None\n- Clarity: Bad/None\n\nHere is the conversation:\n\nProvider: Hi, [patient's name] I'm [your name], the [nurse/nurse practitioner/physician/medical student] who works with the team.\nPatient: Hi, I'm [your name].\nProvider: Hello. I was asked to see you by your oncologist to speak with you today. You're here to talk about your scan.\nPatient: Yes, I think so. I hope it was okay.\nProvider: It showed recurrence of a mass in the sigmoid colon which is likely adenocarcinoma, if it is the same as your previous malignancy. There was also lymphadenopathy in adjacent regions of the abdomen and pelvis. And a hepatic lesion which could represent a metastasis, though it is not sufficiently characterized on the scan to be sure.\nPatient: I am not sure what that all means but it sounds bad.\nProvider: Well, it's not what we would have wanted, after the response that you had to prior treatment. The chemotherapy and radiation had caused the malignancy to regress and it appeared that there would be a positive outcome. However, now this follow up scan suggests that the response to treatment was not very durable and there may be a recurrence after all. We won't know for sure until a biopsy of the mass.\nPatient: So, the cancer has come back? Is that what you're saying?\nProvider: Unfortunately, it does appear that way.\nPatient: [Pauses, trying to process.]\nProvider: [keeps talking] Next we'll need to talk about getting a biopsy.\nPatient: I'm still trying to understand. This is a shock to me.\nProvider: A biopsy is going to be the next step.\nPatient: What would that involve? I'm not sure I want –”\nProvider: Once I put the order in, it gets routed to radiology and their schedulers will give you a call to set up when to do the procedure. They will need to use CT guidance to target the mass and obtain a sample of the abnormal looking tissue. The sample would then be sent to the pathology lab for them to examine and confirm whether it is adenocarcinoma or some other type of malignancy.\nPatient: So, it might be the same cancer I had before or something different?\nProvider: That's right, we're not sure yet.\nPatient: I already went through a lot of procedures. I'm not sure I want to do that again. It's scary to think about.\nProvider: You made it through the other ones fine. There were no complications.\nPatient: I thought the treatment had worked. This was supposed to be just a routine follow up scan. After everything I went through with the chemotherapy and radiation and surgery... was that all for nothing? This is really terrible. What am I going to do?\nProvider: We'll take it one step at a time. First, we'll determine what the pathology of the malignancy is. We may need a biopsy of the lymph nodes as well. Also some more detailed imaging of the hepatic lesion, likely an MRI of the liver focused on further characterizing that lesion. There are many different types of hepatic lesions, some can be benign cysts but some can be metastases, and the area wasn't fully viewed on the scan that you had. A PET scan can also be useful to look for other possible areas of metastasis.\nPatient: After all that, will we be able to treat this? It was hard going through the treatment before and if this might be that bad or even worse—\nProvider: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.  \nPatient: I feel like I should plan ahead though. If the treatment is going to be awful, I'm worried that I might get sick.\nProvider: Treatments do have side effects. We'll go through all those possibilities when it's time.\nPatient: What if I have more pain? What if I need help at home? I don't want to be a burden on my family.\nProvider: I'll have the social worker come in and talk to you. For right now, we need to gather more information to help make a decision about treatment. The type of malignancy and the degree of metastasis will determine what type of chemotherapy would be recommended. Radiation treatment will also be considered. It's unlikely that surgery would be effective at this stage, although if the colon mass gets larger, there would be a possibility of bowel obstruction which might need to be addressed with surgical intervention.  \nPatient: I thought I did everything I could to prevent this.\nProvider: You did, and so did the team. You had an appropriate first-line regimen and an initial positive response. However, sometimes there is still a recurrence. The risk of colorectal cancer recurrence ranges anywhere from 7% to 42% within 5 years of initial treatment completion depending on the type and stage.\nPatient: I'm not sure what I should do now. It's all so overwhelming.\nProvider: Well, we're out of time for today. Let's set you up for another appointment to talk about this some more. \nPatient: Okay. I'll bring one of my children along if that's all right.\nProvider: Sure. We can all make a plan together.\n", "answer": "Segment 1:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 2:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 3:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Bad\nSegment 4:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Bad\nSegment 5:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 6:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: Bad\nClarity: None\nSegment 7:\nEmotion: Bad\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 8:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: Bad\nClarity: Bad\nSegment 9:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 10:\nEmotion: Bad\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 11:\nEmotion: Bad\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Bad\nSegment 12:\nEmotion: Bad\nPresentation: Bad\nClarity: None\nSegment 13:\nEmotion: Bad\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 14:\nEmotion: Bad\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Bad\nSegment 15:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: Bad\nSegment 16:\nEmotion: Bad\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\nSegment 17:\nEmotion: None\nPresentation: None\nClarity: None\n"}

I have been in a lot of pain; I am so glad that you are here.\nProvider: Well, [insert name], I can make sure that you get the pain medicine that you need.  Do you want to talk about that right now?\nPatient: Well, the dilaudid pill that I am taking, I believe 4mg pills, is not working for me.  I don't know what this meansâÉ\nProvider: We can either escalate to a higher dose of the dilaudid pill or we can rotate to a different opioid altogether.  Or we have a new type of pain medicine named buprenorphine.  It comes in a transdermal patch form.  It acts on the kappa and delta receptors, in addition to the mu receptors.  So it works by a different mechanism and should work better for you.\nPatient: I don't understand what you just said.  I just want my pain to get better.  I also have not been able to sleep and sometimes I cry myself to sleep.  Because, I don't know ...what this pain means...[patient sits silently; about 2 seconds]\nProvider: [keeps talking] Mr. Brown, the pain medicine should also help you sleep.  In this case, maybe we will use the stronger pain medicine â€“ to make sure that you fall asleep.\nPatient: Sleeping would be good.  I worry a lot that my worsening pain means my cancer might be spreading.  And this is a big reason that I cannot sleep; I think about it all the time, day and night.\nProvider: I don't usually prescribe opioids with benzodiazepines together because of the increased risk of overdose death.  The synergistic effects compound the harm.  But in your case, it may be appropriate to take the risk.\nPatient: I really want to talk to you aboutÉ\nProvider: [interrupting patient] Also, you certainly can benefit from counseling.  We have a psychologist here at the cancer center who will be more than happy to speak with you.  The receptionist outside can make an appointment for you.  \nPatient: I have a lot of questions about my cancer and plans that I need to make.

Palliative care?  Like hospice? \nProvider: Yes, palliative care is like hospice. Dr. Waters, your surgical oncologist, asked me to come see you because you're having more pain. The working hypothesis is that the etiology of your pain is from progression of your cancer, likely metastasis to your lungs, and there is some evidence of new hepatic lesions on your recent imaging. \nPatient: I don't understand. That sounds really bad. Are you saying my cancer is worse?\nProvider: Look, statistically, it could be much worse. The report from the radiologist says your lesions have only progressed by less than 5%. And there are many new therapies on the horizon, like some novel immunotherapy agents that have been shown to increase overall survival and shouldn't be too awful.\nPatient: I'm really scared, you're scaring me. What does that all mean? Are you saying I'm at the end?\nProvider: [PAUSE – count to 10]. Well, that's a very negative way to look at things. You should remain hopeful.

Alright, let me see what's in your chart here about your medications. You were taking a relatively low-dose of opioid agonist, oxycodone, q4 hours prn PO with no long-action opioid. It doesn't look like you were on a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or neuropathic agent, which is interesting. Are you having chemotherapy induced neuropathy?\nPatient: Umm, I really don't know. Could we go back to what you—\nProvider: [Start talking at ‘back’].  Wow, look at the time. Okay, I've gotta run. There's an in-service and they are serving Subway sandwiches, I don't want to miss it. We'll make some changes with your medication. Hopefully, it won't knock you out too much.
