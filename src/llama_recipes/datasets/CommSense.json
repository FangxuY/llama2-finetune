So being comfortable and more rested would help tremendously. But also, now that I am thinking more about it, it would be nice to have some questions answered. I am definitely a planner; I want to make plans but I realize I need information.\nProvider: I understand. Thank you for mentioning that you have more questions about your future plans.

Okay, let's come back to the pain management. I recommend that we replace your dilaudid 4mg tablets with oxycodone 5mg oral tablets – available as often as every 4 hours. This would be our first step. We can have you and your wife come back in a couple of weeks – to reassess your pain and also discuss what questions you have about your cancer and any possible treatments.
