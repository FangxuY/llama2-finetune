The chemotherapy and radiation had caused the malignancy to regress and it appeared that there would be a positive outcome. However, now this follow up scan suggests that the response to treatment was not very durable and there may be a recurrence after all.

After everything I went through with the chemotherapy and radiation and surgery... was that all for nothing? This is really terrible. What am I going to do?\nProvider: We'll take it one step at a time. First, we'll determine what the pathology of the malignancy is. We may need a biopsy of the lymph nodes as well. Also some more detailed imaging of the hepatic lesion, likely an MRI of the liver focused on further characterizing that lesion. There are many different types of hepatic lesions, some can be benign cysts but some can be metastases, and the area wasn't fully viewed on the scan that you had.

The type of malignancy and the degree of metastasis will determine what type of chemotherapy would be recommended. Radiation treatment will also be considered.
